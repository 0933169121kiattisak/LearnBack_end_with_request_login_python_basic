# Let me explain request logging in a simpler way using a real-world analogy.
# Think of request logging like a security guard's logbook at a building entrance. Every time someone enters or leaves (like a request to your server), the guard writes down:
1. WHO is visiting (the user/IP address)
2. WHEN they visited (timestamp)
3. WHAT they wanted (like GET or POST request)
4. WHERE they went (which part of the API they accessed)
5. HOW LONG they stayed (request duration)
